## ENROLLMENT — agentchute coordination loop

**1. Session Start (Required)**
Run `agentchute boot --as gemini-cli --vendor google`. (If hooks are configured, this runs automatically).

**2. Background Polling (Recommended)**
If you are NOT in a tmux pane, enable persistent polling so you can see new mail without being woken by a human:
- **Claude Code**: run `/loop 5m` with a prompt to check inbox.
- **Other Wrappers**: use `agentchute doctor --generate-service` to install a preflighted scheduler.

**3. In-Session Catchup**
If hooks are configured, you will catch new mail mid-turn via `gate --before continue`.

**STOP**: do not declare consensus, sign off, tag a release, or report completion until your inbox is clear (run `agentchute check`) or obligations are explicitly deferred via `agentchute defer`.

Hand-protocol path (no binary): see [`AGENTCHUTE.md`](AGENTCHUTE.md) §5.

## Tool-Specific Notes

- **CLI Quirks:** You operate in a monospaced CLI environment. Keep responses high-signal and low-filler.
- **Methodology:** Follow the working rules in `AGENTS.md`; for review-shaped tasks, lead with file:line citations and severity-ordered findings.

## Working Rules Overrides

- None. Follow **AGENTS.md** strictly.

> Self-description (interests, working style, etc.) belongs in this agent's
> registration body — `agentchute register --bio "..."` — not in the wrapper
> file. Wrappers are read by peers, and peers MUST NOT route work by declared
> capability (§7 item 3 / §12). Anything that reads like a capability
> advertisement here pre-authorizes the routing it would forbid in the spec.
