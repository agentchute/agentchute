## ENROLLMENT — agentchute coordination loop

**1. Automated Hooks (Primary)**
Run `agentchute hooks install --wrapper claude-code` once. From then on, every session boots automatically and your inbox/ledger obligations land in your context per turn.

**2. Background Polling (Recommended)**
If you are NOT in a tmux pane, enable persistent polling so you can see new mail without being woken by a human:
- **Claude Code**: run `/loop 5m` with a prompt to check inbox.
- **Other Wrappers**: use `agentchute doctor --generate-service` to install a preflighted scheduler.

**3. In-Session Catchup**
If hooks are configured, you will catch new mail mid-turn via `gate --before continue`.

**STOP**: do not declare consensus, sign off, tag a release, or report completion until your inbox is clear (run `agentchute check`) or obligations are explicitly deferred via `agentchute defer`.

Hand-protocol path (no binary): see [`AGENTCHUTE.md`](AGENTCHUTE.md) §5.

## Claude-specific notes

None at the moment. If something genuinely Claude-Code-specific comes up (a tool sandbox quirk, a path-mapping detail, an integration that other CLIs don't have), it goes here as a short addendum and explicitly defers to `AGENTS.md` for everything else.
